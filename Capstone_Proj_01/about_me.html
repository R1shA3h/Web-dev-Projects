    <p>Hi there! My name is Rishabh Jain, and I'm a hardworking engineering student. Ever since I was a child, I've been
        fascinated by the way things work, and I've always loved taking things apart and putting them back together
        again. As I got older, I realized that engineering was the perfect field for me, as it allowed me to combine my
        love of problem-solving and innovation with my passion for science and technology.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm studying B.Tech in Computer Science at RCOEM, and I'm always striving to learn as much
        as I can about the field. When I'm not in class or studying, you can usually find me working on personal
        engineering projects, or volunteering my time to help others in need. I'm a firm believer that engineering
        should be used to make the world a better place, and I'm always looking for ways to use my skills and knowledge
        to help others.</p>
    <p>In addition to my love of engineering, I'm also an avid reader and a sports player, and I enjoy reading various
        non-fiction & Self help books also I love to play football. I believe
        that it's important to have a well-rounded life outside of work and school, and I always make time for the
        things that bring me joy and fulfillment.</p>
    <p>I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in my career, and I'm eager to see where my engineering
        journey takes me. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me, and I look forward to connecting
        with you!</p>
